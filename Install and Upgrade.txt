[ Installation ]

1. Edit the CONFIG.PHP.txt file with notepad to contain your MySQL information and save it to EXACTLY "config.php".

2. Upload it, and the rest of ListMail, to your web host into a directory (ie. yoursite.com/mail)

3. Open the directory in your web browser ( http://yoursite.com/mail )

4. Type "install" as the login password.

5. Click "Install".

6. Go to the Config menu.

At this point you're ready to collect subscribers and send emails.  You still need to schedule the cron task on your isp to run dailymail each day.

To set up bounced message processing. see the Help button in it's section in the Configuration menu, or the README.TXT in the /cgi directory for more information.


[ Upgrading ]

1. Overwrite your old files with the new ones.  (Do not overwrite the CGI scripts or config.php unless specified.)

2. Log in to ListMail.
